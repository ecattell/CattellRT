This is a simple command line demo of my raytracer, with my glut-based sequence viewer removed.

--------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS:

To compile, just call 'make' from the root directory.

The program takes one argument, which is the path of the scene file to be rendered. I included some default scene files in the scene subfolder.

An example call would be:
./RaytracerDemo scenes/CornellBoxDefault.txt

All exported images will be in the 'output' subfolder.

--------------------------------

FEATURES:

Stratifed soft shadows, physically-based depth of field, reflections, textures, anti-aliasing, TIFF encoding, BMP decoding, and support for transformation matrices in scene files.

--------------------------------

CAVEATS:

- It does not yet use a BVH, so it only gets N^2 performance with the triangle hit algorithm.
- It's not multithreaded.
- This was my first large C++ program, so I didn't adhere as well as I could have to standard conventions. 

--------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:

All code is my own, except for the following exceptions:
1. The two vector and matrix classes in MathUtil use some code given to us by my Stanford graphics course.
2. Scene::Parse() is based on code given to us in this same course, which allows the program to be compatible with example scene files from some Stanford graphics classes.
